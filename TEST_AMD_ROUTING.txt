I've added comprehensive debug logging to track the AMD preset issue.

RUN THE APP AND DO THIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Start the app:
   python AutoBios.py

2. Go to the Presets tab

3. Toggle the switch to AMD (move it from Intel to AMD)

4. Click the right arrow to navigate to "Advanced Presets" page

5. Look at the console output

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You should see output like this:

======================================================================
[DEBUG] _on_family_switch called: on=True, fam=amd
[DEBUG] Before: self._preset_family = intel
[DEBUG] After: self._preset_family = amd
[DEBUG] Calling _build_adv_page_for_family('amd')
[DEBUG] _build_adv_page_for_family('amd') called
[DEBUG] Cleared 25 widgets from adv_layout
[DEBUG] Building AMD advanced page (25 presets)
[DEBUG] Added 25 AMD preset rows to layout
[DEBUG] adv_layout now has 25 widgets
[DEBUG] Calling _rebuild_preset_view_and_targets()
======================================================================

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ on=True means AMD was selected
✅ fam=amd confirms AMD mode
✅ "Cleared X widgets" shows old Intel presets were removed
✅ "Building AMD advanced page (25 presets)" confirms AMD data exists
✅ "Added 25 AMD preset rows" confirms widgets were created
✅ "adv_layout now has 25 widgets" confirms they're in the layout

COPY AND PASTE THE DEBUG OUTPUT HERE SO I CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
